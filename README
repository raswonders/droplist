Droplist is parser for dropwatch output files. 

Motivation: main goal here is to produce overview of drops captured during 
dropwatch process. Dropwatch output is very limited and lack of any overview
makes problem analysis often more complicated than it needs to be. 

HowTo
~~~~~
1. Capture dropwatch data on desired system by running following shell command sequence.

$ date +%s > dropwatch.txt; echo start | dropwatch -l kas >> dropwatch.txt; date +%s >> dropwatch.txt

Once sequence is executed it will seem to be stuck but that is alright. What happens is that
dropwatch is in foreground monitoring for drops and writing output to the dropwatch.txt file. 
Once sufficient time pass stop execution of dropwatch by CTRL+C. 

2. Run parser against output file from previous sequence 

$ ./droplist.py dropwatch.txt
